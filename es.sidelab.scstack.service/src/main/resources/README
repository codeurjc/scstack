Running the SidelabCode Stack administration console and the REST service:

1. Unzip the scstack-service-bin.zip file and cd into the scstack-service folder.

2. Change the configuration file 'scstack.conf' according to the same file from the installer.

 2.1. Take notice of your REST host and port.
 
 2.2. Open the Redmine page with your browser, login as admin (pass: admin) 
      and copy the Redmin API key to the configuration file. 
      (you'll find it in the MyAccount tab, on the right part of the screen).
 
 2.3. Assign a name and password for the stack's super user.
  
3. Execute the service:

    sudo java -jar scstack-service.jar

4. Next, the web service will be started. 

5. Open the URL http://RESTurl:RESTport with your browser, login as the superuser
   and test the forge (create users, projects, etc.), then open the Redmine page 
   and see if everything works as expected.

   
You can also use the installer from es.sidelab.scstack.installer, if you want 
 the service to be started as a system demon. In this case you only have to 
 configure the 'scstack.conf' file inside the installer's folder.
