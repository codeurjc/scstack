Installation procedure of the forge's system dependencies in Ubuntu Desktop (10.04 LTS):

1. Install the prerequisites (if not already installed):
   
    sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk
    sudo apt-get -y install mysql-server-5.1
    
2. Unzip the 'scstack-installer-bin.zip' file and cd into the 'scstack-installer' folder.
   Inside this folder, there should exist 'scstack-service-bin.zip', which contains
   the installation files for the REST service and web console of the forge. If not,
   then only the software dependencies can be installed.

3. Open the configuration file and change it accordingly:
    
    gedit scstack.conf &
   
   You can find what each parameter means in the SidelabCode Stack's wiki.
   Two important values are the super user of the forge and its password. You use them
   to access the web console when everything has been installed. 
    
4. Execute the installer:

 4.1. You can choose the type of installation to perform by giving a VALUE to the 'type' argument:
	* all     -> install everything and set scstack-service as daemon (default if '-Dtype' is not set).
	* tools   -> install only the required software.
	* service -> do not install any software dependency, only set the service as a daemon.
	        It will attempt to configure Redmine using its web interface (retrieves the REST API key),
	        so it assumes the software dependencies are already in place.
	
    sudo java -Dtype=VALUE -jar scstack-installer.jar

  Note: 
   The Ruby gems take a lot of time to install (during the Redmine installation). 
   Don't despair, they will end eventually.

 4.2. When the REST service and web console have been installed, you can check the daemon's status:
 
    sudo status scstack-service
    
    For the moment, the log file for this daemon is '/tmp/scstack-service.log'.
    
    Open the URL https://RESTurl:RESTport with your browser, login as the superuser
   and test the forge (create users, projects, etc.), then open the Redmine page 
   and see if everything works as expected.

   - Edit project
   - Create subproject
   - Manage members
   then Save.

 1.3. Authentication required: Checked
 1.4. Self-registration: Disabled
 1.5. Enable REST web service: Checked

        Name: pick up a name for the connection
        Host: hostname (default: localhost)
        Port: 636
        Check LDAPS
        Account: cn=admin,dc=sidelab,dc=es (or whatever you specified in the configuration file)
        Pass: LDAP's password from the config file (e.g. ld4p)
        BaseDN: dc=sidelab,dc=es (or from the config file)
        Check 'On the fly user creation'
        Login: uid
        First name: cn
        Last name: sn
        Email: mail
 2.3. Create
 2.4. Press 'Test' in the connections' list
 2.5. Checks the connection has been tested successfully. 
3. Copies the Redmine's REST API key to the configuration file 'stack.conf'.
